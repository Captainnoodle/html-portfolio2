<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	My name is Naomi; I'm from London and am currently learning Web Development
	via Angela Yu's Udemy course "The Complete Full-Stack Web Development
	Bootcamp". I aim to learn numerous programming languages, such as full-stack
	web development, python, C, C#, C++, etc.</p
>

<p>
	My reason for learning to code is to become a software engineer as a career.
	Besides self-taught coding, I plan to return to college and re-do my GCSEs,
	study an access course in Computer Science, attend a Russell Group
	university and gain a bachelor's in Computer Science, preferably UCL. <br />
	I am also working toward learning to code an application that will bridge
	the gap between cosmetics and tech. It will take me a while to complete this
	journey and application, but it is a journey that will help me grow and
	increase my skills.
</p>

<p
	>I will return to this website periodically, update the pages with more
	projects, and add features based on my newly learned abilities so I can
	showcase my understanding and work. I hope you enjoy my website.</p
